### Slide 5: **Endpoint: Job Listings**
- **Endpoint**: `/jobs`
- **Methods**:
    - `GET /jobs`: Retrieve all job listings, supports filtering by location, job type, and keywords.
    - `GET /jobs/{id}`: Get details of a specific job.
    - `POST /jobs`: Create a new job posting (requires authentication).
- **Example Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "1234",
      "title": "Software Engineer",
      "location": "Remote",
      "type": "Full-Time",
      "description": "Develop and maintain software applications..."

          "resume_url": "http://example.com/resume.pdf"
        }
        ```

### Slide 7: **Endpoint: Saved Jobs**
- **Save Job for a User**
    - **Endpoint**: `POST /users/{user_id}/saved_jobs`
    - **Parameters**: Job ID to save.
    - **Purpose**: Allows users to bookmark jobs for future reference.
- **Get Saved Jobs**
    - **Endpoint**: `GET /users/{user_id}/saved_jobs`
    - **Response**: Array of job objects that the user has saved.

---

### Slide 8: **Security & Authentication**
- **Authentication**: API key-based, each request must include a valid key.
- **User Authorization**: Controls access based on user roles (e.g., recruiter, applicant).
- **Data Security**: HTTPS ensures secure data transmission.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per minute.

---

### Slide 9: **Benefits of the Jobs API**
- **Efficiency**: Streamlines job posting and application processes.
- **Scalability**: Can handle large volumes of job postings and applications.

### Slide 10: **Example Workflow**
1. **Create Job Posting**: Recruiter posts a job using `POST /jobs`.
2. **Job Search**: Applicants search for jobs with `GET /jobs`.
3. **Application Submission**: Applicant applies using `POST /jobs/{id}/apply`.
4. **Save Job**: Applicant saves a job with `POST /users/{user_id}/saved_jobs`.
5. **Track Application**: Recruiter updates status with `PATCH /applications/{id}/status`.

---

### Slide 11: **Future Enhancements**
